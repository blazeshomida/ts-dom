# TypeScript Library for DOM Manipulation: Project Plan

## Project Overview

Develop a TypeScript library offering utility functions for DOM manipulation and event handling, focusing on practical web development tasks. This step-by-step approach ensures a deep understanding and application of each concept.

### Milestone 1: Initial Setup

**Objective**: Prepare the development environment, initialize the project repository, and set up for publishing.

**Tasks**:

- Set up the project with Vite in library mode, ensuring a smooth development and build process.
- Initialize a git repository and make the initial commit to establish version control from the start.
- Configure `package.json` for npm publishing, including all necessary metadata and scripts for building and publishing.
- Set up a `.gitignore` file to exclude node_modules and other non-essential files from version control.
- Optionally, set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) workflows for automated testing and publishing.

**Deliverable**: A fully configured development environment and project structure ready for development and eventual publication.

### Milestone 2: TypeScript Basics

**Objective**: Become comfortable with TypeScript's type definitions and syntax.

**Tasks**:

- Define `NullableElement` to represent elements that might or might not be present.
- Create `EventOptions` type to unify boolean flags and objects for event listener options.
- Establish `SelectorOrElements` to allow functions to accept various types of element selectors or actual elements.

**Deliverable**: A TypeScript file with foundational types defined, accompanied by documentation on their intended use.

### Milestone 3: Query Selector Utilities

**Objective**: Learn DOM manipulation using TypeScript.

**Tasks**:

- Implement `qs` as a shorthand for `querySelector`, returning the first element matching a given selector, scoped optionally to a specific element.
- Create `qsa` as an alias for `querySelectorAll`, returning all elements matching a given selector as an array, also scoping optionally.

**Deliverable**: TypeScript functions for simplified DOM querying, with examples demonstrating their use.

### Milestone 4: Parsing and Resolving Selectors

**Objective**: Improve string manipulation and conditional logic skills.

**Tasks**:

- `parseSelector`: Parse a CSS selector string to determine if it targets a single ID or multiple elements, returning the appropriate query result.
- `resolveElements`: Resolve a mix of selectors and actual elements to a consistent set of DOM elements, facilitating operations on them.

**Deliverable**: A TypeScript file implementing these parsing and resolving utilities, including various test scenarios.

### Milestone 5: Event Listener Utilities

**Objective**: Explore event handling within TypeScript.

**Tasks**:

- `on`: Attach an event listener to elements, abstracting away the complexity of handling both single elements and collections.
- `off`: Remove an event listener from elements, similarly handling both individual and grouped elements.

**Deliverable**: Functions that simplify adding and removing event listeners, with documentation on usage patterns.

### Milestone 6: Class and Attribute Utilities

**Objective**: Master dynamic class and attribute manipulation.

**Tasks**:

- Implement class manipulation functions (`addClass`, `removeClass`, `toggleClass`) to modify element classes easily.
- Create attribute manipulation functions (`setAttr`, `getAttr`) for setting and getting attributes on elements.

**Deliverable**: A set of utilities for class and attribute management, showcased through practical examples.

### Milestone 7: Data Attribute Utilities

**Objective**: Efficiently manipulate data attributes.

**Tasks**:

- `setDataAttr`: Set data attributes on elements, simplifying the API for custom data storage.
- `getDataAttr`: Retrieve the value of data attributes from elements, ensuring proper handling of non-existent attributes.

**Deliverable**: Utilities for managing data attributes, along with examples of setting and retrieving custom data.

### Milestone 8: Dynamic Style Manipulation

**Objective**: Programmatically control element styles.

**Tasks**:

- `setStyle`: Apply multiple style properties to elements, handling both individual and collection inputs.
- `getStyle`: Retrieve specific style properties from elements, catering to computed styles if necessary.

**Deliverable**: Functions for dynamic style manipulation, demonstrated with use cases like theme switching.

### Milestone 9: Element Creation, Manipulation, and Cloning

**Objective**: Enable dynamic content creation, manipulation, and cloning.

**Tasks**:

- `createElement`: Facilitate the creation of new DOM elements with optional attributes and children.
- `removeElement`: Safely remove elements from the DOM, handling potential memory leaks.
- `cloneElement`: Clone elements, offering deep cloning capabilities for nested structures.
- Implement utilities for managing child elements (`appendChild`, `removeChild`, `replaceChild`), ensuring proper handling of DOM hierarchies.

**Deliverable**: A comprehensive set of utilities for DOM element management, supported by examples of creating dynamic interfaces.

### Milestone 10: Event Delegation

**Objective**: Implement efficient event handling through delegation.

**Tasks**:

- `delegateEvent`: Enable event delegation by attaching a single event listener to a parent element that handles events from children matching a selector.

**Deliverable**: An implementation of event delegation, showcasing its use in optimizing event handling for dynamic content.

### Milestone 11: Element Size and Position Utilities

**Objective**: Enable precise control and information retrieval regarding element size and position.

**Tasks**:

- `getSize`: Wrap or mimic `getBoundingClientRect` to provide an easy-to-use interface for getting element dimensions and positions.

**Deliverable**: Utility function for retrieving size and position, with examples of applications like collision detection or layout adjustments.

### Milestone 12: Window Utilities

**Objective**: Provide utilities for common window operations.

**Tasks**:

- `onWindowResize`: Handle window resize events, potentially debouncing them to avoid performance issues.
- `onWindowScroll`: Manage window scroll events, offering throttling to enhance performance.

**Deliverable**: Utilities for window event management, demonstrated within scenarios requiring responsive adjustments or scroll-based animations.

### Milestone 13: Keystroke Handling Utilities

**Objective**: Simplify the process of handling keyboard events.

**Tasks**:

- `handleKeystrokes`: Allow the definition of key-action mappings, simplifying the implementation of keyboard shortcuts and navigation.

**Deliverable**: A utility for streamlined keystroke handling, with examples covering common use cases like modal shortcuts or navigational aids.

### Final Project Submission
